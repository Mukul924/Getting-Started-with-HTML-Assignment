Getting started with HTML Assignment



1. Write a simple program in HTML that displays the heading “HTML defines the content and structure of your website” on the web browser?

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>HTML heading</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>HTML defines the content and structure of your website</h1>
</body>
</html>



2. Explain the purpose of comments in HTML and provide an example of how to use comments in an HTML document? 

The purpose of comments in HTML is to add readable annotations or explanations within the HTML code. Comments are not displayed on the web page when it’s rendered in a web browser.
It is primarily used for:
Documentation
Clarification
Temporarily disabling code without removing it entirely
We use ‘<! --’ and ‘-->’ tags to enclose the text to be commented.
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>HTML Document</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>HTML defines the content and structure of your website</h1>
<! -- <h2>This comment will not be rendered to the web browser</h2> -->
</body>
</html>

In the above example “This comment will not be rendered to the web browser” is enclosed with ‘<! --’ and ‘-->’ tags and will not appear on the web page

Arrange these elements to create a simple web page layout?


<!DOCTYPE html>

<body>
<h1>This is the first heading</h1><hr>

4. Write a short note on Tag and element with an example?

Tag: Tags are special markers enclosed with angular brackets’<>’ that define the beginning and end of an element. They are used to specify how content should be structured or formatted on a webpage.

Example: <p>A short paragraph</p>

In this example ‘<p>’ is an opening tag, and </p> is a closing tag.

Element: Element consists of one or more tags and the content they enclose. An element typically starts with an opening tag, includes content, and ends with a closing tag.

Example: <h1>This is a heading</h1>

In this example ‘<h1>’ is the starting tag ‘</h1>’ is the ending tag and “This is a heading” is the content all these together is called an element.






5. What is the DOCTYPE Declaration in HTML?

The DOCTYPE Declaration in HTML (Document Type Declaration) is a special type of declaration at the beginning of an HTML document that specifies the type and version of the HTML being used. It helps web browsers and other user agents understand how to interpret and render the HTML content within the document.
